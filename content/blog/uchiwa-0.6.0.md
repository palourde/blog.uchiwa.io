### Redesign of the panels header

The first notable change is the conversion of the data center selector to a drop-down menu. We also moved all controls, such as the *actions*, *subscriptions* and *hide*, to be aligned with the datacenter menu.

### Subscriptions tooltip

We added tooltips containing all subscriptions of a particular client or event to help you keep track of them and promote their usage.
