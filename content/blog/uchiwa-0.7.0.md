We are pleased to announce the release of Uchiwa 0.7.0. Various major improvements have been made to the user interface, in addition to some small bug fixes.

You can [download Uchiwa 0.7.0](https://uchiwa.io/#/download) right now and [view the changelog](https://github.com/sensu/uchiwa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#070-2015-03-13). It's already available for download on the Sensu repositories.

### Reorganization of the navbar and sidebar

Most of the icons from the navbar were redundant with the ones available on the sidebar, so we decided to merge them on the latter. The *information*, *settings* and *logout* action buttons are now accessible on the navbar, as shown on the screenshot below.

### Aggregate view

The *aggregate* view has been refactored in order to use multiple panels and be contained within a single page, just like the *client* view.
